# Use a Stacked Ensemble to predict Titanic passenger survival

This repo contains steps and code to demonstrate how to build a Stacked Ensemble with scikit-learn on Watson Studio. The model will address the Titanic passenger survival dataset available at Kaggle

Some familiarity with Python is helpful.

## Prerequisites

* An [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com)
* An account on [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/).


## Steps

1. [Setup project in Watson Studio](#1-setup-project-and-data-in-watson-studio)
   * [Create a project in Watson Studio](#11-create-a-project-in-watson-studio)
   * [Create a notebook in Watson Studio](#12-import-the-notebook-into-watson-studio)

1. [Create and test a Stacked Ensemble model with Watson Studio](#2-create-and-test-a-stacked-ensemble-model-with-watson-studio)
   * [Start stepping through the notebook](#21-start-stepping-through-the-notebook)


### 1. Setup project in Watson Studio

In Watson Studio we need to: create a project and  upload our notebook.

#### 1.1. Create a project in Watson Studio

* Log into IBM's [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com). Once in, you'll end up on the landing page.

* Create a new project by clicking `+ New project` :

   ![studio project](images/ss1.png)

* Enter a name for the project name and click `Create`.

#### 1.2. Import the notebook into Watson Studio

* Click on **Add to project** and then click on **Notebook**

   ![add to project](images/ss2.png)

* Click on the **From URL** tab, name the  notebook `Stacked Ensemble Titanic`

*  Enter the following URL for the **Notebook URL**

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djccarew/predictive-model-on-watson-ml/master/examples/exampleOutput.ipynb


### 2. Create and test a Stacked Ensemble model with Watson Studio

Now that we're in our Notebook editor, we can start to create our stacked ensemble model  by stepping through the notebook.

#### 2.1 Start stepping through the notebook

* Click the `(â–º) Run` button to start stepping through the notebook.
